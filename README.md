# flakemake

A graphic snowflake generator using PyGame.

This program makes extensive use of recursion to generate snowflakes. 

Hotkeys:
  SPACE - generate new flake
  a - increase symmetry base n (a real snowflake has a symmetry base of 6, for example.)
  d - decrease symmetry base
  s - simpler flake generation (lower recursive depth)
  w - more complex flake generation (higher recursive depth)
  q - reduce edge length (smaller flakes)
  e - increase edge length
